    <p><strong>User Interviews</strong></p>

    <figcaption class ="port-desc">
      <p>The user interviews helped me get an understanding of what my visitors would
        want from my portfolio website. I asked questions that would give me an idea
        about what their interests are, and what they would need from someone
        like me. <p>

    <p><strong>Competitor Analysis</strong></p>
    <img src="img/f/f_ca.png" alt="Alcove Beats">
    <figcaption class ="port-desc">
      <p>In my competitor analysis, I looked at the personal websites of people
        that run their business around themselves, something that I also strive to do.
        Most of these websites were based around music marketing.<p>

    <p><strong>Feature Value Matrix</strong></p>

    <figcaption class ="port-desc">
      <p>My feature value matrix allowed me to realize that my features that I desire
        are not actually the most important. What I realized mattered most is content
        and how it is displayed.<p>

      <p>I enjoyed creating this feature prioritization, from it I decided to link
        my websites associated with my business.<p>

    <figcaption class ="port-desc">
      <p>When creating the user stories it made me think about possible scenarios
      that I would not have prepared for otherwise, these helped me better understand
    how my audience would react to my website.</p>

    <figcaption class ="port-desc">
      <p>The cognitive walkthroughs were fun and helped me get in person advice
      about my website. When watching users go through my website I realized I had
    too much content and should narrow it down.</p>

    <img src="img/f/f2_ut.png" alt="Social Media Marketing">
    <figcaption class ="port-desc">
      <p>For my user tests, I did a 5 second test that asked users what they thought the website was about. The
      answers were surprisingly good. I also did a click test that asked them to navigate to my music, I realized that people would
    click on the menu button first, and then scroll down and click on the desired button.</p>

<p><strong>Summary of Findings</strong></p>
<figcaption class ="port-desc">
  <p>These findings allowed me to widen my perspective on what users want when looking at a portfolio website. Sometimes you
  can get caught up in making the website easy to use for yourself but when you put your website in front of the users you want
to target you will quickly realize that they want things different.</p>
<p>The main realization I had was that I had too many words in my portfolio. Sometimes I get carried away with the amount of
  words to choose to include, and this can add unneccesary fluff. Another thing I had to get rid of were the large sizing of pictures,
  at first the pictures took up the whole page and while I felt that it made my website feel different, others found it a hassle to navigate through.</p>
  <p>Finally, these findings have allowed me to realize what I need to add to my portfolio if I want it to be beneficial in the long run. People asked about
    my resume, whether I had more projects, and more descriptions of the skills I had.</p>

<p><strong>Incorporation of Findings</strong></p>
<figcaption class ="port-desc">
  <p>I plan to incorporate many things that I learned from these findings. The main thing lacking from my portfolio was that I did not include my resume
  and a better description of the skills that I have. I will do this in the future as I continue to build my resume and use this website in a more benefitial way.
This website was meant to just give a feeling for what I like to do, what I enjoy doing, and was not focused on being a portfolio to send recruitesr.</p>
  <p>One thing that people looked for was an easy way to listen to my music. One user mentioned that I needed embedded players in my website to help make it easier
  to listen to my music. I agree with this, I hate going to another website when asked to do something like listen to music.</p>
